                    <h5>Describe your stores return policies</h5>
                      <p>The first step is to fill in the return application.</p>
                      <p>Please enter "Personal Center My Order" within the return period (please pay attention to the description of the goods). Click "Application after sale" to fill in the return application.                        </p>
                      <p>Step 2: Waiting for customer service confirmation                        </p>
                      <p>After submitting the return application, the Koala Customer Service will complete the confirmation within 1-3 days. The confirmation results will be communicated with you in time through SMS.                        </p>
                      <p>Step 3: Send the returned goods                        </p>
                      <p>After the return application is approved, please send it back by ordinary express according to the address provided by SMS and return page.</p>
                      <p> If you need a koala to bear the freight, please advance the freight and do not receive the paid and postal parcels for the time being.                        </p>
                      <p>After the returned goods are sent out, please update the logistics information of the returned goods according to the requirements on the order return page.                        </p>
                      <p>In order to ensure the smooth delivery of your goods, please ensure that the logistics information is true and effective, while keeping your contact phone open.</p>
                      <p> (If, within 14 days from the date of approval of the refund application, you have not filled in the name of the refund flow company and the information of the waybill on the after-sale page, then your application form will automatically be turned off without approval.)                        </p>
                      <p>The fourth step is to complete the refund after the customer service receives the refund.</p>
